## Checkpoint 2:
### How can you see what tests were run for a particular submission?
#### Under the test column you can click on the number of tests passed or failed which will take you to a list of tests run.
### Can you see what the error condition was for a submission? How does this help you debug the failure?
#### Yes, you can see the error condition by clicking on the number of errors in the error column, which takes you to a list of errors. This is helpful in debugging becuase it shows you the error status and gives a suggestion on what the problem could be. Ex: "Did you forget to inlclude(CTest) in the toplevel CmakeLists.txt?"
### How clean is the dashboard? Are there any errors that you need to be concerned with?
#### For most windowns systems similar to mine the dashboard seems clean and there appear to be no errors I should be concerned with.
