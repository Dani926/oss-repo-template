# Lab4 - Open Source Licensing
## 3 - Why is it important to choose a licence?
A license lets you choose how to protect your rights as an author while distributing your project as you see fit. Without a license, it's not clear what your intentions are for the project and people may not want to use it or contribute to it.

## 4 - Why is it important that you SHOULDN'T use a project that doesn't have an explicit license?
With no license, default copyright laws apply. Using, modifying, and/or distributing software with no license could cause legal problems for you.

## 5 - Open System Model Section of Why the Web beat Gopher
### Do you agree with this claim?
I'm not sure I agree with the claim. The article makes a good argument that Gopher failed to follow the open source philosophy and broke the trust of some technologically-savvy users. However, it's not clear to me that these users were really a major reason Gopher failed; the article argues earlier that it was actually non-technologically-savvy users who avoided Gopher in favor of simpler tools. It seems like the non-technical users were probably a much larger group, and therefore more important to Gopher's success or failure.

## 6 -  Linux uses GPLv2
### Can you justify why such a license is chosen based on the history, goals and philosophy of the project?
Linux is closely related to GNU, so using the GPL makes a lot of sense. When Linus [adopted the GPL](https://mirrors.edge.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/Historic/old-versions/RELNOTES-0.12) he noted that the previous license was already close to the GPL except that it limited commercial use. The Linux kernel is now nearly always integrated into the GNU Project and included in GNU/Linux distributions, so using the GPLv2 or something else compatible with GNU copyleft is necessary.
